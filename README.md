# unit-4-game

This project is a test of some additional jQuery knowledge than I had in my previous project. It's about click events on an image, and the **this** keyword.
This game can not always be completed. That's fine, as the instructions were laid out it seems impossible, but we always do our best. Just click a few crystal balls, see if the planets align and you can win! Courtesy of the *math.random()* random number generator.
